# MovieReviewAnalysis
A sentiment analysis supervised learning problem. 
Before watching any movie we do read the reviews and check it's rating. A little time consuming!
All we want to know is whether the reviews are positive or negative.
Well then let's do that ...
We train our classifier based the movie reviews in the "Data" directory containing 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews.
